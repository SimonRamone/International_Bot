Dictionary class implemented, it generates a trie and inserts all the word into tree.
contains a check function that will check weather or not the word is a correct word.

Challenge button now activates the search function:
->if player challenges and it's successful, player being challenged will loose points and get the tiles from the challenged word back.
->if player challenge unsuccessful, the player who chose to challenge will loose turn.

can run the Board.UI to start the game :)

also we created the jar file, but for some reason it wont show up in intelliJ but it is in the artifacts folder of the project
in cmd we had to type "java -jar C:\Users\jackl\IdeaProjects\International-Bot\classes\artifacts\International_Bot_Assignment4\International_Bot.jar
for it to work

Run the executable jar file on in terminal.
Input, java -jar International-Bot.jar to run the jar file.
